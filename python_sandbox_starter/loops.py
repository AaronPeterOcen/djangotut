# A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

pp = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']

# simple loop
# for person in pp:
#     print(f'Current Person: {person}')
    
# Break
# for person in pp:
#     if person == 'c':
#         break
#     print(f'Current Person: {person}')
    
# continue
# for person in pp:
#     if person == 'c':
#         continue
#     print(f'Current Person: {person}')

# range
# for i in range(len(pp)):
#     print(pp[i])
    
# for i in range(1,100):
#     print(f'number: {i}')

# While loops execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.

# a = 0
# while a <= 10:
#     print(f'count: {a}')
#     a++
